"""A card the installed PyTorch wheel has no kernels for must be named as such
(#3067).

The loader already falls back to the CPU for a card outside the wheel's
architecture list (an sm_52 Maxwell on torch 2.8+cu128, which ships sm_70+).
What the GPU report did *not* say was the truth about the remedy:

* the host was presented as accelerated, with a vague "may fail at kernel
  launch" caveat and no remedy;
* once #3079 excludes the unusable accelerator from the probe, the host fell
  through to the report's build/vendor mapping, where an NVIDIA card with a
  CUDA build has no ``"cuda"`` key - so it defaulted to
  ``nvidia_cuda_unavailable``, i.e. "CUDA could not start";
* whose remedy is "update the NVIDIA driver", i.e. exactly the thing that
  cannot add the missing kernels.

So the user was told to do the one thing that would not help. The report must
name the real cause (the wheel has no kernels for this card) and offer a
remedy that can fix it (a build that covers the architecture).

Every host shape here is a fake - no torch, no GPU - so this runs on any CI OS.
